This project is aimed at providing visual images of the surf conditions in scheveningen compared to the weather conditions at the time of the snapshot. This way, you can get a feel for how the sea will look with a certain forecast. 

Once i have a dataset of a many images there will be an image roughly of every surf condition in a year in the Netherlands for Scheveningen.
